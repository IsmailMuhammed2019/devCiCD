## Task

In this stage, you'll step into the shoes of a DevOps engineer and deploy a static website onto a cloud platform.

### Steps:
1. **Cloud Platform:** Choose a cloud platform of your preference (AWS EC2, Azure, GCP, etc) to deploy your website.
2. **Web Server:** Select a web server software like NGINX or Apache to serve your static website content.
3. **Website Preparation:** Ensure your static website files (HTML, CSS, Javascript) are ready for deployment.
4. **Server Configuration:** Configure the chosen web server (NGINX or Apache) on your cloud instance to serve your website content.
